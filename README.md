This is a simple app of Authors and its Publications using Angular 7 in the frontend and AWS in the backend.

Each project has it's own readme for development and deployment with the serverless framework.

I recommend that you first follow the instructions of the Backend folder.

I did this in my free time during a week so its missing some important stuff like unit testing, end to end testing and backend validations.
